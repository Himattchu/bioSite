               Her immediate family consists of 4 people. Her Father: Hung, Mother: Dianne, and brother: Matthew.
               However, that isn't enough to describe her true immediate family. Due to everyone on her Mother's side
               being close, those members are those she considers to be her true immediate family. They consist of Grandpa: Henri,
               Aunts: Phuong, and Khanh, Uncle: Chuong, cousins: Victoria and Genevieve, 
               and dog: Sparky.

                Beatrice met Jeffery and starting dating him back in 2015. It all 
                started as she began employment at the Great Wolf Lodge, and it was love at first sight. 
                Together they have gone on trips, cosplayed in differnt costumes and continue to grow 
                their affection for one another. Who knows? One day she might get married to him.
