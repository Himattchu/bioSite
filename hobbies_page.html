            Her latest obsession, Her first big adult purchase. After our previous dog 
            passed, it left a pretty big hole in her heart. She couldn't be without 
            a dog. Hence the adoption of our current dog Sparky. He was nursed in Oklaholma, and 
            so Beatrice took a road trip with Hung (father) and Jeffery (boyfriend) in order to meet the 
            breeder halfway aka New Mexico to pick up the Austrilian Shepherd. From that day on he was 
            known as Sparky Beam Trinh.

        <h1> Arts and Crafts</h1>
        <p>
            One of her favorite past times is doing Arts and Crafts. It brings her a sense of tranquility 
            and allows herself to be distracted from the real world. She has made items that are gifts, 
            purposed for educational use and so much more. She has helped design and decorate many rooms 
            and parties as well.
